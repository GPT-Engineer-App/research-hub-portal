# research-hub-portal

An applied R&D organization website with sections for research topics and papers. The website should have a professional and modern design, focusing on showcasing the organization's research areas, ongoing projects, and published papers. It should feature a navigation bar with links to different sections, including 'Home', 'About Us', 'Research Topics', 'Publications', and 'Contact Us'. The 'Research Topics' section should detail the various fields of research, whereas the 'Publications' section should list research papers with options to view or download them. The color scheme should be sleek, using blues and whites to convey a sense of innovation and reliability. Fonts should be clean and professional, such as Arial or Helvetica, to ensure readability.
